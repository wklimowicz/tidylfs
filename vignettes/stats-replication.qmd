One way to quality assure the data compilation is to attempt to replicate official ONS statistical publications. Below are a few snippets which replicate several official LFS statistics. Contributions via pull request are welcome.

### EARN04

[ONS Publication](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/datasets/grossweeklyearningsoffulltimeemployeesearn04)

```r

# Unemployment

### UNEM01 NSA
