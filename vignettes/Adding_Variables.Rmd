# Overview

* tidylfs is designed to be easily extended. Adding variables and summaries is a few steps:

    * If your variable isn't currently in the compiled dataset, run `lfs_extra_mappings()`.
    * Find the relevant variables in the ONS User guidance.
    * Add them to the function.
    * Load the function, and pass it as an argument to `lfs_compile`:

```{r}
lfs_extra_mappings()
```
